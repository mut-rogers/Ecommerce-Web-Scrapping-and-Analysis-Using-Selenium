# E-Commerce Web Scrapping and Data Analysis Using Selenium 

## Business Problem 
**Objective:** 
To gain insights into the pricing and popularity trends of products on a specific e-commerce platform.

**Stakeholder Needs:** 
To understand the competitive landscape, identify pricing strategies, and potentially inform product development or marketing decisions. Identify high-performing products to potentially feature or promote.

## Data Collection
**Data Sources:** The primary data source is the specified e-commerce platform.

**Data Collection Methods:**
 - <u>Web Scraping with Selenium</u>: Selenium will be used to navigate the website, interact with dynamic elements (if any), and extract the required data.

 - <u>This will likely involve:</u> Locating and extracting product URLs, Navigating to individual product pages, Extracting product details such as price, description, and ratings.

**Considerations:**
- <u>Rate Limiting:</u> Implement appropriate rate limits to avoid overloading the website server.

- Website Changes: Be prepared to adapt the scraping logic if the website structure or content changes.

- Ethical Considerations: Ensure compliance with the website's terms of service and robots.txt.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
 **Handling Missing Values:** Address missing values in price, description, or rating fields (e.g., imputation or removal).

 **Data Transformation:** This will involve,
  - Convert price data into a consistent numerical format.

  - Clean and standardize product descriptions (e.g., remove HTML tags, lowercase).

  - Convert rating data into a numerical format (e.g., if ratings are in text format).

  - Create new features (e.g., price per unit, normalized ratings).

  - Data Validation: Check for inconsistencies, errors, and outliers in the extracted data.
